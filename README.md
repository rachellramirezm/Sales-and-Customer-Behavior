## 🔎 Key Business Insights

- Revenue is retention-driven: 91% of daily revenue comes from repeat customers, indicating that frequency and loyalty—not one-time acquisition—are the primary revenue drivers.

- Loyalty outweighs gender: Gold-tier customers generate the highest revenue across all genders, confirming that loyalty level is a stronger predictor of revenue than demographic segmentation.

- Gold customers drive both volume and value: The Gold tier leads in total revenue and Average Order Value, demonstrating that high-loyalty customers purchase more often and spend more per transaction.

- Revenue is highly promotion-dependent: 63% of total revenue comes from discounted transactions, with Silver customers showing the highest dependency—posing potential margin risk if discounts are not optimized.

- Cleaning is the core category: It contributes ~40% of revenue across all regions and dominates spending among high-loyalty customers, positioning it as the anchor category of the business.

- East is the top-performing region: Leading in total revenue, making it a strategic priority for scaling initiatives or product experimentation.
